## Notes for instructor
I used temaplate style in my compopnents, I know this is not the most efficient way but I felt more comfortable by applying templates in Vue for this project. I also tried to add watcher at the end by invoking the history counter method that I created previously. The purpose was to delete history section automatically after the round numbers reached out to 5 but everytime I tried I messed things up so I removed it.
Tahnks for teaching us this framework, this project was very helpful for me to understand the basics of Vue and Javascript.
