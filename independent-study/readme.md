Note: My independent study ideas were different than tech comparison. My ideas were about testing and machine learning in Vue. I realized that there are too many dynamics to read and too many practice I need to do in order to reflect these studies so that is why I decided to work on the comparison among these technologies. At the end my purpose is to learn more about these frameworks and be able to get more familiar with their syntax features.
