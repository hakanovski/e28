# ANGULAR vs REACT vs VUE

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF ANGULAR JS
Angular is started between 2008 and 2009. It was a part time project of Misko Hevery who is still a developer at Google currently. This project’s purpose was to simplify web application development and, making user-friendlier framework for web developers. Further to that Misko did not want to worry about the activities at the back end during the web development process, he wanted to build simple web applications on static web servers. After that his co-worker Adam Abrons joined to this project and they together invented the Angular. They released their 1st Angular package in 2009. First people in Google did not understand what is this Angular and Misko explained it that it is like a Spread sheet in cloud so we can put data and save it without concerning about security, etc. and also he stated that all UI will be in HTML.

After that Misko’s manager Brad Green wanted him to work on Google Web Tool kit (GWT) and Misko and his team wrote around 17000 lines of code for improving GWT, which was very clunky framework for developers in Google to develop their internal tools. Misko came up with a claim that he can write entire GWT framework with Angular in 2-3 weeks and he wrote entire GWT in 3 weeks with 1500 lines of code. After that entire GWT has been shipped with complete Angular JS.

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF REACT JS
React came into existence in 2011. Jordan Walke who was working in Facebook on that time, he created its first library. He has been inspired by the XHP, which is a HTML based framework for PHP. Facebook decided to use React for the website’s newsfeed for the first time. After the good feedbacks and better performance gain Facebook decided to use it in Instagram as well. They built entire Instagram system with React. In 2 years React’s community has grown and Facebook decided to make it open source in 2013. In 2015 Facebook announced React Native, which was for easier development in Android and iOS platforms.

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF VUE JS
Vue JS has been created by Evan You in 2014. He was working at Google and he joined many projects made with Angular. He created this framework by filtering all negative specifications of Angular and React.  While he was working for different Angular projects he realized that people were writing too many repeated html lines, which was time and resource consuming. That is why he came up with and idea for creating tool for rapid and effective typing. His main purpose was to creating more lightweight and progressive framework for building user interfaces.

## HOW POPULAR ARE THEY?
All these 3 main frameworks have been adopted heavily by different industries for different purposes. When we look at the GitHub statistics we can clearly see that Vue has received more stars for its repository, second one is React and third one is Angular. Vue has 163K, React has 148K, and Angular has over 60K stars as of now.

However tech industry is still looking for more React and Angular developers. Vue is gaining a lot of popularity in the last 3 years. Below graph is from back in late 2018.

According to the Indeed.com, current open positions over 60.000 jobs mainly require React knowledge. After that Angular and only 0.8% for Vue.

## DYNAMICS & MAIN CAHARACTERISTICS OF VUE
After comparing the syntax and the functionality of Vue with the other 2 frameworks, Vue is more liberated by it means it has more customizability and flexibility. While I was working on my components in projects, almost every time I can reflect my ideas easily by using the components. I can combine both behavior of the website and UI at the same time by working enough on components. In my last project Vue allows me to use pre processors, which is a great option for developers. I used Babel and in future I want to use Sass with Vue for design specific purposes rather than CSS. Plus I think it is easier to learn about directives and components when comparing with the other two.

Vue’s community is also very big and almost every time Vue’s main site helps me to overcome simple to difficult issues.  Another great point of Vue is two-way data binding. I realized how easy it is with “v-model”. I also checked the same process in React and it is extremely long.

Currently the main problem of Vue is not as much popular as React or Angular because it is the newest framework but companies are gradually passing to this technology. For example Laravel community has mentioned many times Vue is one of their preferred frameworks.  In future if companies want to migrate from Angular or React to Vue, I think, there will be more solution created more widely especially for big projects migration. Today Alibaba, EuroNews, Adobe, Behance, Gitlab and Reuters are using Vue.

## DYNAMICS & MAIN CAHARACTERISTICS OF REACT
Actually for analyzing the learning curve of React, it is not bad. I feel like still Vue. Js is easy to learn but when I checked the documentation I did not find it as hard as Angular. Its syntax looks like HTML like syntax and React’s website has huge and detailed documentation. I followed the forums and people are benefiting from React’s fast virtual DOM implementation and it is a great supportive framework for server side rendering related tasks. Since it has been created by Facebook, its community making this framework very popular and today’s many high tech companies are using this framework. According to the QA engineers it is easier to test React codes than the other two frameworks. Automation can be done easily and developers can migrate between versions easily. 
However for many developers JSX can be unfamiliar in most of the conditions and for learning phase it is slower than Vue I believe.

For example, let’s focus on HelloWorld example for both frameworks.

## DYNAMICS & MAIN CAHARACTERISTICS OF ANGULAR

Angular is the oldest one comparing with the rest and because of this its community is bigger and most of the problems have been resolved and a lot of solutions have been provided to Angular developers. However when I check the Angular syntax it is very complicated. Since I do not have a commercial experience in Javascript and I can count myself as a beginner developer, it is not a right choice for most of the beginners. 

I made a little bit research about Angular language service and auto completion is a great future. Error checking is a very useful feature during the development phase and developers can easily address the potential issues earlier.

Learning Angular is more difficult than the others and it requires more time. In order to get better in Angular you need to learn more about TypeScript and MVC. For the big projects and tight deadlines, mot probably companies are not selecting Angular, their preference is more likely React or Vue in some specific cases.

I checked the main templates and event requests over Angular’s website and here is the example for delete request:

Here is another example for User list component uses the @Input property.

## Vue:

## FINAL DECISION
Since I am mostly familiar with Vue and I like more user-friendly frameworks, my preference will be Vue. However I am sure it is worth to try to learn React since it is widely used and it is not hard to learn the basics like Vue. I am sure Vue will be more adopted by the companies in future and it is worth to make a time investment on learning and improving the skills. For the simple projects it is great to start with Vue, it is highly effective, flexible and customizable. Of course it depends on which framework to choose but at the end of the day Vue is more practical for me. I hope I will get into the level that I can easily say for a specific project I should use React or Vue.
