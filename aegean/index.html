                <p class="card-box card-primary"> In AEGEAN there are 3 types of cards. With cards class you can create little cards in your contents and put some important information into these cards. 
                    This is a great method to give a strong mention about these information. 
                    Card variables are located in "cards.scss" file. You can also see the card colors, margins and padding variables inside the "variables.scss" file.
